The matrix multiply will have three loops. One two go sequentially through
the rows and one to go through the columns.  Due to the nature of matrix 
multiply each time a value is calculated N must be traversed again. This 
gives three loops total.  I would expect that the time complexity would
be at a cubic level. 

Since each of the loops must loop through for the entire N and the loops
do not shorten over the iterations, I would expect O(f(N)) to be nearly
equal to the average run rate theta(f(N)). 

Calculating the value for the rows is a constant proportional to the matrix
length. If the matrix is a sparse matrix the time hit for calculation will
be bigger but not by much so will affect run times minimally.

______Data________________________________________

At 1% random fill
 100 =  0.0071 sec
 200 =  0.0201
 400 =  0.1817
 800 =  4.823  
1600 = 78.85
3200 =854.9  

At 10% random fill
 100 =  0.0055 sec
 200 =  0.2050
 400 =  0.1794
 800 =  4.764
1600 = 79.43 

At 100% random fill
 100 =  0.0079 sec
 200 =  0.0341
 400 =  0.2696
 800 =  5,514
1600 = 82.99


_____Questions_______________________________

1. The smallest M that gave a non-zero time for 1% random fill was
   10 seconds
2. The time complexity appears to have followed a cubic magnitude.
3. A size of 3200 for all three fill percentages was more than the 
   reasonable limit for this configuration. I ran the 3200 size at 1% 
   fill and it yielded a time of 14.24 minutes (854.9 sec).
4. The effect of increasing the fill percentage had a slightly bigger
   effect than I had guessed.
